# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as:
- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Fare**: Fare the passenger paid for the ticket
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

The dataset files included in this repository:
- **train.csv**: Training data for the model
- **test.csv**: Testing data for the model
- **gender_submission.csv**: Gender-based submission for reference

## Files

- **Titanic_Survival_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that contains the machine learning model used to predict survival.
- **Copy_of_Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb**: Another version of the notebook with possible variations.

## Technologies Used

- Python
